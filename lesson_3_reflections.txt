When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? When I'd like to share my work with others as well as have others contribute to the work. I'm learning also that GitHub can be used to keep a back of the work as well as allow it to be accessed from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? It seems the most relevant answer is that it gives me control over the changes. This question was a bit tough for me to definitively answer. I took a look at some other answers to get some ideas. The two other pieces that I now understand is if I always pull changes manually then the code will not change without me expecting it. The other that makes sense is that if I know my code is broken I might not want to pull the changes until the bug is fixed. So I guess my first sentence of having control over the changes is applicable.
